### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# I'm [Satish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satish-solanki-7715394b/) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist and Software Engineering professional with 10+ years of experience in Data Science and IT. I specialize in developing machine learning models, enhancing data security, automating testing, and optimizing data pipelines for efficient analytics solutions. I am proficient in Python, Java, Rust, and PostgreSQL, and I have strong experience in data analytics and visualization.

Other than that, I spend most of my time reading about the latest developments in AI and solving problems in data science projects wherever I can.

I have thrived in a fast-paced environment, where I have taken ownership of complete data solutions, collaborated extensively with cross-functional teams, and ensured that data-driven insights support business objectives.
