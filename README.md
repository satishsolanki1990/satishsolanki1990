# Hi, I'm [Satish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satish-solanki-7715394b/) ðŸ‘‹

I'm Satish, a Data Science & Software Engineering professional with 3.5 years of experience where I am working on implementing various features to operate on encrypted values in the Postgres Database.  
Other than that I spend most of my time reading the latest developments in the AI realm and solving problems of data science projects wherever I can find.

I have thrived in a fast-paced environment where I've taken ownership of complete data solutions, collaborated extensively with cross-functional teams, and ensured that data-driven insights support business objectives.
